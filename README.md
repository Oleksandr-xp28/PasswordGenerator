# Password Generator

This code prompts the user to enter the length of the password and which character sets to include in the password. The input is validated to ensure that the password length is an integer between 1 and 20, and that the user inputs only "y" or "n" for each character set.

The code uses a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may occur when the user inputs a non-integer value for the password length. This is a good way to handle errors and ensure that the program does not crash if the user inputs invalid data.

The code also uses while loops to ensure that the user inputs valid data for each character set. If the user inputs invalid data, the program will prompt them to input "y" or "n" again.

Overall, this code is a good example of how to prompt the user for input and validate that input. However, it does not generate the password itself. The next step would be to use the user's input to generate a random password.

This password generator is a Python script that generates random passwords based on user preferences. The user can specify the length of the password and whether to include numbers, symbols, uppercase and lowercase letters in the password. The script uses the random and string modules from Python's standard library to generate random characters from various character sets.

To use the password generator, simply run the script and follow the prompts. The script will validate the user input and generate a password that meets the user's specifications. The generated password is displayed on the command line.

This password generator is useful for anyone who needs to create strong passwords for various online accounts, but wants to customize the password to their own preferences. It can also be used as a teaching tool for students learning Python programming. Feel free to modify and adapt the code to suit your own needs.
